/*
 *REVIEW COMMENT SUMMARY: I liked how this project was done overall. For the most part the separation into different header
						  files makes the code easy to follow and to modify. I could be wrong in the biggest change I made to
						  'Shape defs.cpp' but it just didn't really seem to flow. I just feel like a method for a class should be
						  contained in that class. It makes it easier to debug and to look at the class as a whole.

						  I learned a bit from Brandon as well. Using a switch instead of a series of if statements makes a lot more sense.
						  In the future I'd like to use his methods for drawing shapes instead of mine. Mine iterate through the entire
						  surface to draw each one. His only examine and draw within a small area that he can guarantee the shape will be in.
